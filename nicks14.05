 * Task: Write a program that behaves like an 
 * "AI" and asks the user multiple questions.
 * ********************************************/

/*Some questions depend on the answers to previous questions
Some answers are remembered and come back as part of later questions
The programme never ends – it can go back and re-ask questions and overwrite previous answers
The “AI” picks up on inconsistent answers(e.g. if the user answers one question with a yes
and later contradicts this, the AI will respond accordingly)*/
